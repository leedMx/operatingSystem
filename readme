This OS is being created by following this video series:

Special thanks to Viktor Engelmann for his effort

====================
For convenience, you can create a bootable iso image.
To create the iso get into the src directory and run:

make [image].iso

The image will be created outside src to prevent clutter.

--------------------

Alternatively, you can just compile the kernel using:

make kernel.bin

And have a bootloader point to it.
