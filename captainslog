Personal log
====================
This is going to be my first OS, based initially on the youtube video series at
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4

However, this is more of a personal exercise to get comfortable learning and using development tools
Most people would see the project as a n00b idea because:
I haven't really programmed anything worthwile yet
I have never used the tools involved to create anythiing significant
I have never managed an open source project
I have spotty knowledge on all related subjects and no formal education on the matter

Nevertheless, I think that's exactly why this project has to be done
Is a "mostly focused" project 
I like to learn on the go

"...Knowing and not doing is ultimately not knowing..."

====================
I just downloaded port.h and port.cpp from github repo due to 2 main problems
1.File in repo is quite different to the one on video
2.I did try to make the one on video work but kept having errors at compilation due to assembler junk, will try to solve it trough stack overflow

I will keep my versions as portb inside the project hoping i can actually make it work to understand what happened, I've been trying to troubleshoot it myself but no luck, the main problem so far is that i don't really understand what the constraints in asm command do.
====================
I'm back, rewrote the readme to be more effective.
To be honest I don't quite remember where I left off or how does this works, I will look around and see if I can get back on track.
Just noticed that according to git log I used my own portb, but is not reflected on any other log.
Dang, I was a mess on my workflow, hopefully this will change.
Included a summary of how to use makefiles, moved all into a src folder now logs are neatly on the upper level and readme is clearer.
Set everything up to continue working, altought I will have to watch all the videos again, since I'm a bit lost
I have 20 previous commits, most of them irrelevant, you can tell that I did not know how to use git back then.
The repo was forked by what I assume is either another programmer who assumed he could handle more than what he really could do.
I will delete the repo and restarted with todays state as the initial commit.
