Personal log
====================
This is going to be my first OS, based initially on the youtube video series at
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rnA6wpF0o4

However, this is more of a personal exercise to get comfortable learning and using development tools
Most people would see the project as a n00b idea because:
I haven't really programmed anything worthwile yet
I have never used the tools involved to create anythiing significant
I have never managed an open source project
I have spotty knowledge on all related subjects and no formal education on the matter

Nevertheless, I think that's exactly why this project has to be done
Is a "mostly focused" project 
I like to learn on the go

"...Knowing and not doing is ultimately not knowing..."
